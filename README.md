## Understanding the JSON Structure

The structure will consist of an array of objects. Each object corresponds to a row in your spreadsheet.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "url": "https://www.aventissystems.com/dell-p1424h-14-ips-type-c-lcd-portable-monitor/",
    "options": {
      "Choose Screen Size (inches)": [
        {
          "option": "14-inch",
          "link": "https://www.aventissystems.com/dell-p1424h-14-ips-type-c-lcd-portable-monitor/"
        },
        {
          "option": "24-inch",
          "link": "https://www.aventissystems.com/dell-p2423d-24-ips-qhd-1440p-monitor/"
        },
        {
          "option": "27-inch",
          "link": "https://www.aventissystems.com/dell-p2723d-27-ips-qhd-1440p-monitor/"
        },
        {
          "option": "32-inch",
          "link": "https://www.aventissystems.com/dell-p3223de-32-qhd-usb-c-hub-monitor/"
        },
        {
          "option": "34-inch",
          "link": "https://www.aventissystems.com/dell-p3424we-34-curved-usb-c-hub-monitor/"
        }
